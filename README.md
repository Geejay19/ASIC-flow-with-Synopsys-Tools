# ASIC-flow-with-Synopsys-Tools-
This project demonstrates a complete ASIC design flow for a Matrix‑Vector Multiplier (MVM) UART System, starting from RTL and progressing all the way to physical layout (GDSII). This  project has done as a part of the " {System}Verilog for ASIC/FPGA Design &amp; Simulation" course I followed.
